            <h3>Channel Islands Beach, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Channel Islands Beach is an unincorporated community in Ventura County, California, United States consisting of three historic neighborhoods: Hollywood Beach, Hollywood by the Sea, and Silver Strand Beach. This densely populated narrow 1.3-mile-long strip (2.1 km) along the coastal edge of the Oxnard Plain was subdivided using the glamor of Hollywood to sell lots in the mid 1920s since the sand dunes had been used for movies. Adjacent development has left this sandy beachfront neighborhood hemmed in by Channel Islands Harbor and Naval Base Ventura County. The harbor mouth separates them into two communities resulting in a round-about travel route around the harbor between them although the Channel Islands Beach Community Services District provides local utilities services to the entire neighborhood. The Special-purpose district has an elected Board of Directors which provides a forum for the unique concerns of the community. Lying immediately adjacent but outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Oxnard and the City of Port Hueneme, they are governed by the county Board of Supervisors.</p>

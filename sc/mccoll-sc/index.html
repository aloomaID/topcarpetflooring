            <h3>Mccoll, SC Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>McColl is the home of the Pee Dee Indian Tribe. They are a relatively small American Indian tribe that has occupied the Pee Dee region for several centuries. While they received state recognition from the Government of South Carolina just after the beginning of the 21st Century, they have been seeking federal acknowledgment since 1976. While today the tribe consists of just over 200 enrolled members, they were once a significant cultural and political power in the region. Their profound influence and continual presence in the area is why the region bears the Pee Dee name. Since 1976, the tribe’s official seat of government has operated on land awarded to the tribe in Marlboro County.</p>

            <h3>Marlene Village, OR Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Marlene Village is an unincorporated community in Washington County, Oregon, United States, and within the Portland metropolitan area. It is located immediately northwest of Cedar Hills and south of the Sunset Highway (U.S. 26), lying east and west of Murray Blvd. Marlene Village began as a 400-home 'low-cost residential development' on which construction started in early 1949. It was named after Marlene Schnitzer, the then-infant granddaughter of the project's Portland-based developer, Harry Mittleman. The first block of 50 homes went on sale in August 1949. Fire protection and EMS services are provided through Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue.</p>
